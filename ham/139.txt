Hello and welcome to the Stony Brook University community,


As the time of your arrival draws near, several issues need to be resolved
by you before classes begin on August 25, 2014.

ALL Stony Brook students must meet  Stony Brook University’s Immunization
Policy which is detailed at this web address
http://studentaffairs.stonybrook.edu/shs/services/immunize.shtml  Students
must meet the University’s immunization policy before the start of
classes.  Failure to do so will result in you being removed from classes or
you will be stopped from enrolling; this will impact your student visa so
please take care of this immediately.  The form can be found at this web
address
http://studentaffairs.stonybrook.edu/shs/forms/immunization_form_2012.pdf
The completed and signed form can be faxed back to Student Health Services
(631) 632-6171 or dropped off in person before the start of classes.

In addition, please log into your Stony Brook University SOLAR account
immediately and address the several items/ messages that the University has
posted.   Log into the Solar System at this web site
https://psns.cc.stonybrook.edu/psp/he90prods/?cmd=login.  Information and
help for students about SOLAR can be found at this web site
http://it.stonybrook.edu/services/solar/solar-for-students.

Once you have addressed and resolved the issues in SOLAR and sent in your
completed immunization form, you will be able to register for fall 2014
classes.  You register for classes in the SOLAR system.  Your fall 2014
schedule is as follows:

1.  EMP 502, Engineering Economics

2.  EMP 504, Quantitative Methods in Management

3.  EST 581, Methods of Socio Technological Decision Making

4.  EMP 524, Supply Chain Management.

Prof. Teng and I will be on vacation from August 14 to August 24.  Please
stop by on Monday, August 25 to meet with me to discuss any additional
issues you may have.



Sincerely, Marypat Taveras
