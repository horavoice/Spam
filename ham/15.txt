Dear Weijia Xiong:

Your Student ID# is: 109772666.

You are receiving this e-mail because your graduate program has indicated to The Graduate School that they have forwarded your admission package to us for final processing and that they have extended an offer of admission to you.  The purpose of this e-mail is to inform you of your student ID# and to allow you to place a deposit on student housing in the event you accept this offer.  Once you have indicated your acceptance and your admission is fully processed, you will receive an additional e-mail indicating registration holds you may have and providing additional information about the Graduate School and Orientation.

For housing you may log onto: SOLAR http://www.stonybrook.edu/solarsystem to pay your housing deposit.  Additional information regarding housing can be found on the Campus Housing website at: http://studentaffairs.stonybrook.edu/res/index.shtml.
