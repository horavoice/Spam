Dear Weijia,

Thanks for your quick response.

You are still studying at 3am in the morning. You should go to sleep.

It should be OK.  Please let me know if you receive any email from SBU.

When you submit the I-20 request form. Did you uploaded " Sponsor annual
income". if you did, Please email the income letter.

Thanks,

Lynn
