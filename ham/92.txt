Dear Prof. Gucciardo,

I'm Anthony XIong, the class monitor of the SJTU-SBU GOM Program. I°Æm 
sorry that I cannot come to our class in Jun 22nd, since my undergraduate 
class will have a class tour this weekend. To make a precious memory of 
undergraduate time, this tour is important for me and for all my 
classmates. We don't want anyone to be absent from this tour.

However, there are some scheduling conflicts with our first class. Frankly 
speaking, I wish I could come back to Shanghai earlier to join you, not 
only for experiencing the significant first class, but also for performing 
duties as a class monitor. I apologize for that.

I'd appreciate it if you can briefly introduce the content and schedule of 
the lecture. I will surely digest the covered knowledge, and I will 
exhaust my ability to assist you with contacting other classmates and 
organizing our class well.

Thank you for understanding. Looking forward to your reply.

Sincerely,
Anthony Xiong
