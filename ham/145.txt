I will forwarding exam  to all before class electronically.   It is my 
recommendation to get to the school as soon as possible and if you do not 
arrive by 9 am,   we can make arrangements for you to have extra time due 
to your special  situation.

Prof. Gucciardo,

Few days before, I was informed by Cathay Pacific Airlines that my flight 
to New York (originally scheduled arriving time is 7:00 am, Aug 21st) 
would delay for 1 day. I have already booked the pick-up service so that I 
can come to school earlier (may take around 90 minutes), but I still 
wonder I would be late for the final exam starting at 9:00 am. So sorry 
for that.

Surely the final exam is very important for me. Is there any solution to 
that issue?

Thanks for your understanding and looking forward to your reply.
