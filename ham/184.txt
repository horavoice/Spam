Hi Weijia,



We last spoke some time ago in the Citibank branch on Madison Ave & 42nd St=
.  We have been working on the student credit card application for you and =
we need some additional documents to continue the process.



Would you be able to email or fax me the following documents?



- 3 months of official statements from your bank account back home.  Last t=
ime we printed out a few things but unfortunately there was only one bank s=
tatement there.

- A print-out of the university's student information system website showin=
g your name, the school's name, and your address.



Please let me know if you need any additional help or have any questions ab=
out the documents we need.  The objective is to establish you financials fr=
om home and to receive something for address verification purposes.



Thanks!


Regards,
