Hello Anna,

I'm GOM student in Stony Brook. I have some questions about our tuition
fees. First, the tuition fee is $10,095, but IAA paid $10,092 for us.
Second, now we are still charged $50 late payment, since IAA did not pay
for the fees before 9/15. Lynn told me that we don't need to worry about
this, and the $50 would be deleted from list. Can you deal with these
problems?

Looking forward to your reply.

Thanks,
Weijia Xiong
