Subject: Re: SBU GOM Fee
Hi Rosey, 


Yes, the fees were paid last week to SJTU. It should be updated to all students accounts soon or in another week, because SBU usually has a few days delay in accounts processing appearing online.


I hope this helps! 


Best,

Rosie,


If you have the student list, can you send again, so Annie has the updated information? 


The extra $50 is for 2 students who did not pay their fist fees to SJTU on time.  Therefore, we did not for them until they paid SJTU.  These 2 students should be responsible for their late fees.  However, IAA will pay the fees for them, but I will write them a letter to let them know it is not our fault.  


Thanks
Michelle

Hi Rosey, 


Can each student email me and Lynn a phone screenshot of the fees posted online? Weijia did this already. This screenshot of the payment will help us know how to detail the fees to SBU.


We can send the fees ASAP.
Thank you!

Dear Michelle,
 
Thanks a lot.

Today other students said the same question to me.
 
Could you please deal with the question quickly?
 
Because SBU inform the students to pay the  fee until  Oct. 15th

So the students are worried.
