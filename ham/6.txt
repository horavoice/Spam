Hello Anthony,

Please remind the other students that the Humanities Research Paper
assignment is due by midnight tomorrow.  Please email them to this address.

It should be 3 pages in length, contain at least 5 sources (at least one
book, one journal and an internet source), and be in MLA format.  For the
correct format please see page 379 of the Writer's Reference book and also
look at the sample research paper on page 408.

If you have any questions, please let me know before 5pm on 12/25.

All the best,
