Subject: EMP524 Team for RFID

 

Dear Professor,

 

Since I chose RFID as my hw3 topic as early as last week, I have been working on this hw a couple of days. So does my classmates Weijia Xiong, Yuting Wu and Brian Zhang.

Since we are roommates, we want to join together to be a new team working on RFID and I take the leader. 

I would appreciate it very much if you can kindly consider our situation and approve our proposal. 

Thank you~ 

 

Sincerely,

Nannan Su
