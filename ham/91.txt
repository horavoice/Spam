Dear Prof. Gucciardo,

I'm Anthony Xiong who is studying EMP 506 Operations Management. Now I 
have some questions finding corresponding textbook. 

I have already found a "flexible version" of 10th edition(Heizer) instead 
of its traditional version, however, the comments online inform that this 
flexible version doesn't include homework assignments and questions. Is 
this version suitable for our courses?

In addition, I have found the 11th edition(latest) of Operations 
Management, published by Pearson Hall. Can I use the 11th edition for 
classes?

Lots of thanks. Looking forward to your reply.

Anthony Xiong
