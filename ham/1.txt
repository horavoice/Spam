we have class on Saturday.

Until Saturday, here is the* revised* schedule for our class assignments:

1.  Will will *not* complete the "one page essay on literary topic of
interest"....however, for the students who were in class last time, please
bring what we wrote in class and will we discuss this.

2.  Our first assignment will be the Annotated Bibliography and Thesis
statement for a Humanities Research Paper.  This will be due the morning of
our Sunday class, *12/22*.  *Please allow time on Saturday evening to do
some research and to write this assignment*. I will give instructions in
class on Saturday.  In the meantime, please think about what you might want
to research and write about!

3.  The final draft of this research paper is due on *12/25* by midnight.
 Please email it to this address.  No draft is required, but you may email
me a draft if you have any questions.

4.  On the morning of our class on 12/28 your Annotated Bibliography and
Thesis statement for Social Science Paper is due.
