Dear Rosey,


Thanks for the list. 


We will help to make the arrangement for student's arrival.  


All the student will arrive in the afternoon. So they may need to live in the hotel one night since the campus dormitory office will be closed at 4pm. 


Option:  Student live in the hotel, or student service center (Cheap, less than $80 / per room ) our NJCU students usually live there before they found apartment ) in Flushing. Student can take the Rail Road to the School.


or We can call the Car service company to take them to the School. 


In Flushing,  Student can open the account and buy the Cell. This is very important. For opening the bank account. They need 2 photo  IDs . Passport and  (身份证）, I-20. 


Student should pay for the Hotel and car service fee. 



Thanks,


Lynn
