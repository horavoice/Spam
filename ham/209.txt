Hi Weijia,  

I hope you're having a wonderful day! My name is Jeanne and I am an account verification specialist with Trust and Safety Team here at Airbnb. I received your video, thank you!

Thanks for completing the requested verifications!  We've gone ahead and set your reservation request to a Pending status. All your host needs to do now is accept your request and your reservation will be confirmed. We recommend messaging your host to let them know so you can start planning your trip.  

To learn more about the status of your reservation request, visit https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/85. Please note that if the host pre-approved your stay and you submitted your reservation request within 24 hours, the reservation will be automatically accepted at this time.  

Happy travels,

Jeanne M.
