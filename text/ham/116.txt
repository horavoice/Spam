Dear Weijia，
I'm sorry that I may not do that for you. Cause if the householder said
they need a family, usually they cannot be negotiated. If we lie to them,
the consequence may not very good..
You can see the links that Rosey sent to you, I picked them up from all the
housing resources, it may help you. Please reply me ASAP, because good
property may order by others soon.
Thank you.

Best,
Tiki
