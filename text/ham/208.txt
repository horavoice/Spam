Have you thought about renting your room or home out while you're traveling? Not only can it help pay for your trip, but we'll refund you $23 after your first reservation! If you <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/new?euid=c2d81c11-8293-fd19-a8ec-504937de868e">add a property</a>, we'll refund you $23 one week after your reservation is accepted. A property can be an extra bedroom or your entire apartment (if you are often not there). Make money while having fun!

Thanks,
The Airbnb Team
