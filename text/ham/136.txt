Provide herein in the Chap 12 lecture material and homework for this week 
pertaining to the Chap 12 lecture on Invventory Management, due Sunday 
eve, Aug 10.  In addition,  as I will explain in class... due to some of 
the scheduling difficulties we have had with having students to travel 
back to Shanghai on Aug 12-13,  we have decided to have normal on line 
lectures on Aug 12-13 and have a Final Exam ( will cover all lecture 
materials)  on Friday, Aug 22 at SUNY Stonybrook.    Should you have any 
questions regarding this,  feel free to ask during lectures Tues and Wed 
of this week.
