Dear Professor,

Since I chose RFID as my hw3 topic as early as last week, I have been working on this hw a couple of days. So does my classmates Weijia Xiong, Yuting Wu and Brian Zhang.
Since we are roommates, we want to join together to be a new team working on RFID and I take the leader. 
I would appreciate it very much if you can kindly consider our situation and approve our proposal. 
Thank you~ 

Sincerely,
Nannan Su
