Hello Weijia,

Can you get the entire group together so we can all discuss the classes
that you will need to take next semester?  The best time for me next week
is Tuesday between the hours of 12:30 PM and 1:00 PM.  We can meet in
Harriman Hall, room 132.

Let me know if you can get everyone together for this meeting.  Marypat
