Dear Weijia,

It's great to hear from you!

I am attaching our scans of your financial documents, which includes your
signed Affidavit of Support. You can take a screenshot of these docs and
upload them. Please use .pdf, as that is the format we usually use for our
own uploads of student materials with SBU.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Annie
