 I have added your name to the list of new graduate students who were
unable to pay deposits by the deadline.  This is by no means an assurance
or promise of any offer of housing.

You should aggressively search for off-campus housing, as it is unlikely
you will be offered any type of on-campus housing.

The only way we will use the list that I have added you to is if we receive
an excessive number of cancellations.

Here is a link to off-campus housing:
