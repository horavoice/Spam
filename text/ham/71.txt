Dear Xiong,

Did you fill out your I-20 form yourself? Do you know what is the status of
your application? If you received a letter from SBU about an I-20 form,
please forward it to this email so we can have this information on file.
Please send us your Stony Brook Email, SOLAR ID and NetID.

Thank you and I look forward to hear from you.

Sincerely,
Anna Kataeva
