Dear Xiong,

SBU has forwarded the tuition fee to SJTU.

We have contacted SBU and asked them to updated student's account.

Please pay the fees other than the tuition Fee.

Thanks,

Lynn

The page on SOLAR system remains the same. IAA should pay the $10,095.00
tuition fees for us. AFTER THAT, we can pay other fees. Please check it
ASAP. Thank you.
