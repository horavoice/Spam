Question: Do you really think we need to switch off mobile phone while airplane takes off?

Answer from Matt Wasserman
If cell phones could cause plane crashes just by being on or in use, they wouldn't be allowed on airliners. Period. Your iPhone would wind up in a bin behind the TSA checkpoint, unless you decided you'd rather not fly that day.

Question: How do you hunt a sniper?
