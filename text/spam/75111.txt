Question: What do you order or not order at a restaurant you have never been to?

Answer from Kent Fung
Unless it is specifically known as the restaurant's specialty, their claim to fame, I never order the ubiquitous roast-chicken variant on the menu. I feel that roast chicken is basically something every chef puts on the menu because he feels like he has to, and while I'm willing to believe it's competently done, I'm betting it's not what he puts his heart into.

If the restaurant has a claim to fa

Question: What is the best food that Americans have contributed to the world?

Answer from Steve Black
I love all the other great foods mentioned but most are variations of dishes already known elsewhere. I think the greatest American food is the Cornflake.
Invented in America by an American. Three cheers for Mr Kellogg.

Question: Where do rich people get their meals?

Answer from Jon Mixon
In the United States, since you are now required to pay employee taxes on your employees, undocumented or not, the number of personal cooks has dropped dramatically. Coupled with more opportunities for women (the primary people taking such a role) in the workforce, the number of wealthy people who have their own private cook or chef has plummeted.

If you have less than $50-75 million in personal

Question: Is getting rich worth it?

Answer from Robert D Hosken
Hi Anon,

Thanks for your post: it's an interesting discussion. I'm almost 70 now, my wife and I were consultants, sent our 2 children to private colleges, and earned $1M or so before age 50, so we retired early and devoted our lives to charity. We could have easily earned another $1M, but we also could have been dead: each of us have been in near-fatal car crashes that totaled our cars, and each

Question: What would the White House's reaction be if North Korea (or any foreign country) released a film depicting the current U.S. president being assassinated?

Answer from Dan Holliday
You mean, besides all the American films / TV series that:
 * Depict the death and/or assassination of the President?
 * Portray the sitting president as a moron while implying a connection to a woman's pubic hair?  ("That's My Bush! [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_My_Bush ]").  
 * Portray the sitting president as a cartoon idiot.  ("Lil' Bush [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil%27_Bush ]"

Question: What is the most devastating event in human history that ultimately proved to be our biggest benefit?

Answer from Joe Geronimo Martinez

The Black Death, a 14th century plague that wiped out between a 1/3 and 1/2 of the population.

It had two benefits. Firstly it lead to local healthcare initiatives. These weren't much beyond quarantine and burying the dead, but importantly governance of the country meant more than raising taxes and fighting wars.
Local people saw the benefit of effective rule. The kingdoms faced revolts seeking

Question: What should be my reaction if my child trips and falls?

Answer from Matt Wasserman
They probably aren't hurt - kids are pretty light and their bodies are pretty resilient - so don't assume they are. That 3 second delay between the fall and the crying is usually the result of them reacting to you. You freak out, making them think something terrible has happened, so they start crying. 

Wait and see what they do. If they seem ok, help them up if they are still down. Let them go ba

Question: When does something have "too much garlic?"

Answer from Stephanie Vardavas
Many years ago my friend Tom was learning how to cook. He got hold of a recipe called "Chicken With 40 Cloves of Garlic," which he had eaten at a friend's house, and decided to try it.

The problem was that Tom did not know the difference between a clove of garlic and a head of garlic.

So he cooked a chicken with 40 heads of garlic.

This was too much.

The house needed to be aired out for days.

Question: Why do people want to live in the US rather than other developed countries?

Answer from Aamir Ogna
This is a good question and one that I asked myself when I was deciding whether to come here or not. My primary purpose was studying here and then if things went well, work and live here. As it turns out, everything did go well.

This has turned out to be a long answer so, tl;dr:

USA is a land of immigrants, made by immigrants. No one here can accuse you of being an outsider unless they are Nativ
